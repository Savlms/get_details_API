This first line brings in a library called Express, which makes it easier to create web applications and APIs using Node.js.

The 2nd and 3rd lines set up your web application using Express. app is like your web application, and it's configured to run on port 3000.

This 4th part creates a specific URL endpoint (/my-details). When someone visits this endpoint using a web browser or a tool, the server responds by sending a JSON object containing your details.

myDetails: This is where your personal details are stored. It's a JavaScript object with properties like name, address, phone, etc.

When someone accesses the /my-details endpoint, this line sends back your details in a JSON format as a response.

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running at http://localhost:${port}/my-details`);
});
 This starts your server and listens for requests on port 3000. The console.log line just prints a message to the console, telling you that your server is running and where you can access it.
